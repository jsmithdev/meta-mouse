# Meta Mouse üê≠

## Work in progress salesforce cli tool


### Requirements

`sfdx` - https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli

`node` - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Early releases are published for testing so can install with npm as normal

üìå Note the dash in the early npm name that is not in the command

```bash
  npm i -g meta-mouse
```

With it installed, you can run `metamouse` anywhere/time you need

```bash
  metamouse
```

You'll be greeted with options which you can use arrows or fuzzy search to select üê≠

### Working

- fuzzy search cached usernames & options
- select username to set current username & cache it
- refresh list of usernames from sfdx & cache list for quicker switching
- open org in browser (uses selected/cached username)
- quickly add usernames to sfdx
- had dev org success w/validation count
